        <p>
            We wanted to gather information on popular trails. We used a National Parks Trail dataset from Kaggle. 
            In this dataset only 3,060 trails were gather and reviewed in 29 States and the Island of Maui. We wanted to see which places had the most trails.
            As well as gathering the top 5 most reviewed trails with the best ratings.
            The dataset provided reviewed the trails by: trail id, name, city name, state,geo location, popularity, hike difficulty,
            average rating, and number of reviews.

        <h2>Our Process:</h2>
        <p> We started off in Jupyter Lab with a CSV file. We cleaned up the data, 
            and added two new columns from the geoloc column that we “split” to get the latitude and longitude.
            We gathered all the columns we wanted into our data frame to then but into our database by creating an engine.
            We also used an online geojson converter to use for our map cluster. 
            As well as another Json converter to use for our filtered table.
